This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get the
application up and running.

Things you may want to cover:

Currently the app runs with
* Ruby version - 2.5.3
* Rails version - 5.2.3
* React - 16

Unit Testing

Rails - Minitest

React - Jest and Enzyme

After cloning the app usual steps should do the job, `bundle;rails db:setup;yarn`.

Used foreman to start up both webpacker dev server and rails server, running `foreman start` should kick both.
